sometimes at the campus sport center, sometimes hikes, climbing bike tours, etc with friends. the mixture of school, party, sport and digging elephant traps works out pretty well for me. i love my life.  i like to travel and get to know new people/cultures/food/etc. whenever possible. fun times usually means having crazy parties in the co-ops i live in, but we also go for more quiet evenings with board games/movies/chilling in front of a cozy fire.... i studied a funny mixture of electrical engineering and management, joining a student club gave me the possibility to visit a lot of countries during my study. during a year in madrid i started to love the spanish culture and even learned the language a bit,  after i got my master, my professor offered me to go on with a ph.d. in berkeley, so i ended up here in this lovely place. to finish it, i'll stay here at least some years, maybe longer, depending what arises then. -ending up in strange, funny situations / places -playing (board, sport, tricks), i don't care if i loose -smiling my german accent movies: thriller and drama, mainly those, which make me think. my favorite is the devil's advocate  books: fantasy books, with heroes and vampires and wars and princesses and dragons and whatever our imagination can come up with...  music: hmm, indecisive, it always depends on my mood, electronic music in my best mood, but hiphop is fine for dancing, too  food: everything, especially if i haven't tried it yet. if it's delicious i eat it again. i'm not much into german food, too heavy, but i'm always down for asian food delicious food getting to know something new traveling making fun of myself and everything else sport my freedom/flexibility i don't worry much, so i have a lot of time putting thoughts into nicer things, which randomly come to my mind for my research it doesn't matter if it's friday or tuesday, so i might be in the lab, focusing an ion beam or in a bar, dancing on a table  ...you want to get

was taken and 2hopefulromantic was too long... lost the \"c\". oh well ... where do i start. okay, i am a simple human being, yet with a deep soul, who has a heart of gold and who believes in fairy tales. however, i also believe that the pillars of any successful relationship are understanding, loyalty, honesty, compromise, the will to make things work, communication and respect. i believe in fate too and that people meet for a purpose of higher nature and that there is a reason for everything.  i have waited and continue to wait for my \"dream girl\" and don't mind waiting my whole life for her. i have promised myself to stay single and not to marry for the sake of being married only; i will marry when i fall madly in love with that special woman who will make my heart miss a beat every time i see her or even just think of her. just to clarify, my \"dream girl\" is not a model via the way she looks, because looks alone does not define my \"dream girl\". also, i am not going to make a long list of all the things she should be. if i did that, then i might miss a really good woman. however, for simplicity sake, i would say that i like the woman who is loyal, romantic, sweet, compassionate, sincere, genuine and who honors, nurtures and/or takes care of her mind, body and soul.  by knowing me, you would discover that i am genuine, a true gentleman, compassionate, romantic, loyal and faithful, sensitive, introvert to some degree, humble and down to earth. i dislike with passion those who play games or those who lie and cheat. i am not into one night stand, never was and never will be. watching the rainbow and hearing a laughing child make me happy; they re-enforce my hope in everything good in life. when it comes to dealing with people, i am a strong believer in the saying, treat people as you like to be treated. oh, and i love poetry (write when inspired) and good dark chocolate (with almonds and/or strawberries yet better).  i love walking, enjoy long distance driving and beginning to play tennis once again after a long layoff.  thank you and best of luck to you. trying to finish and publish my fourth book while working a normal job; it is not easy. putting things together. i guess it comes from my mechanical background. very good at being organized and keeping things clean and neat. i guess that i am the quiet type until they know me better. i like reading about self improvement books. i love most works by dr. leo buscaglia ( living loving & learning, loving each other, love: what life is all about, the way of the bull: a personal search for fulfillment), and deepak chopra. i also appreciate pbs programs that present amazing individuals such as dr. wayne dyer. i enjoy listening to modern rock and new age music, such as: ottmar liebert, u2, depeche mode, morrissey and the smiths, the cure, andrea bocelli, yanni, era, michael buble, don henley and the eagles, enya, adele, and i think i should stop here. i dislike rap. also, when the moment is right perhaps jazz or classics even though i know little about the two. my favorite movies are: becket, gone with the wind, doctor zhivago, spartacus, east of eden, when the legends die, the other side of the mountain, ghost, shawshank redemption, gladiator, the last of the mohicans, the english patient, the piano, titanic, love story, sleepless in seattle, the notebook, among few others. food, hmmmmmmm, i love thai, japanese, lebanese, korean, vietnamese and chinese. i enjoy a good kobe burger and having lunch at fresh choice or sweet tomatoes. listening to the sound of the spanish guitar or piano, discovering new places or learning about new cultures, being with family or good friends, reading, walking and being who i am. how i could make a difference in this short yet wonderful life. depends hummmmmm, love to hold hands, hug and kiss. you are simple, romantic, honest, genuine, a one man woman and you are guided by values and principles.\n","Matched user:\n","\n","my lifestyle alternates between two extremes. one of them is living each moment of life as it were my last - traveling, dancing, hiking, acting, swimming, meeting new and awesome people, just getting out there and trying things that i've never tried before. the other is nerding up in true stanford style and building something cool and exciting. i work at facebook - trying to make your online social life more exciting :) it's a pretty satisfying feeling that things i build will be used by millions of people every day. of course, it reaches a totally different level of awesomeness when someone publishes an article on them ;) dancing (i am involved with a few dance groups here and there - i choreograph too.. used to teach salsa to beginners in my dance company during senior year), acting, writing, reading palms, organizing parties, attending parties, making jello shots, coming up with a list of things i'm bad at, talking to random people, impromptu adventures, figuring out new technology, philosophical discussions that my hair is always messed up one of my favorite books is 'never let me go' by kazuo ishiguro. it's a seemingly innocuous tale about a little girl, but raises some major concerns about how far science can go without pushing the limits of what is ethical and morally justifiable. another one of my favorites is 'a brief history of time' by stephen hawking. it's the best way to learn about the inner workings of our universe without looking at a single mathematical equation.  music: the beatles, guns n roses, aerosmith, led zeppelin, ac/dc, coldplay, latin music (because i can dance to it) and hip hop music (because i can dance to it as well)  movies: lots of them. in general i like movies that leave you with something to think about rather than mindless big-budget money-spinners. - traveling - daily workouts/dance breaks - a job that pays and i like (rare combo, trust me) - my phone - my swiss army knife - a box of dark chocolate truffles at an arm's reach traveling and where i want to go during my next vacation. i've traveled a fair amount and love to go out and see new places. i'm hoping to set foot on every continent before turning 30. dancing/partying/hanging out with friends when i go shopping i spend way too much time trying things on you.. :  - are good at striking up a conversation - are self-confident yet humble - know how to dance - like to travel.. - ..and have a bunch of crazy stories from your time in ibiza - are a super powerful and stunningly beautiful vigilante from the planet zorg - are a bikini model.. - ..who is also a particle physicist - are into inline skating - can do the butterfly stroke - own a ferrari.. - ..that you're willing to let me test-drive - have a great idea for what facebook should do next - are an economics major who can warn me before the next recession - can cook like my mom - are 32 but look 23 - are 23 and look 23 - are 18 but sound

\\\"c\\\". oh well ... where do i start. okay, i am a simple human being, yet with a deep soul, who has a heart of gold and who believes in fairy tales. however, i also believe that the pillars of any successful relationship are understanding, loyalty, honesty, compromise, the will to make things work, communication and respect. i believe in fate too and that people meet for a purpose of higher nature and that there is a reason for everything.  i have waited and continue to wait for my \\\"dream girl\\\" and don't mind waiting my whole life for her. i have promised myself to stay single and not to marry for the sake of being married only; i will marry when i fall madly in love with that special woman who will make my heart miss a beat every time i see her or even just think of her. just to clarify, my \\\"dream girl\\\" is not a model via the way she looks, because looks alone does not define my \\\"dream girl\\\". also, i am not going to make a long list of all the things she should be. if i did that, then i might miss a really good woman. however, for simplicity sake, i would say that i like the woman who is loyal, romantic, sweet, compassionate, sincere, genuine and who honors, nurtures and/or takes care of her mind, body and soul.  by knowing me, you would discover that i am genuine, a true gentleman, compassionate, romantic, loyal and faithful, sensitive, introvert to some degree, humble and down to earth. i dislike with passion those who play games or those who lie and cheat. i am not into one night stand, never was and never will be. watching the rainbow and hearing a laughing child make me happy; they re-enforce my hope in everything good in life. when it comes to dealing with people, i am a strong believer in the saying, treat people as you like to be treated. oh, and i love poetry (write when inspired) and good dark chocolate (with almonds and/or strawberries yet better).  i love walking, enjoy long distance driving and beginning to play tennis once again after a long layoff.  thank you and best of luck to you. trying to finish and publish my fourth book while working a normal job; it is not easy. putting things together. i guess it comes from my mechanical background. very good at being organized and keeping things clean and neat. i guess that i am the quiet type until they know me better. i like reading about self improvement books. i love most works by dr. leo buscaglia ( living loving & learning, loving each other, love: what life is all about, the way of the bull: a personal search for fulfillment), and deepak chopra. i also appreciate pbs programs that present amazing individuals such as dr. wayne dyer. i enjoy listening to modern rock and new age music, such as: ottmar liebert, u2, depeche mode, morrissey and the smiths, the cure, andrea bocelli, yanni, era, michael buble, don henley and the eagles, enya, adele, and i think i should stop here. i dislike rap. also, when the moment is right perhaps jazz or classics even though i know little about the two. my favorite movies are: becket, gone with the wind, doctor zhivago, spartacus, east of eden, when the legends die, the other side of the mountain, ghost, shawshank redemption, gladiator, the last of the mohicans, the english patient, the piano, titanic, love story, sleepless in seattle, the notebook, among few others. food, hmmmmmmm, i love thai, japanese, lebanese, korean, vietnamese and chinese. i enjoy a good kobe burger and having lunch at fresh choice or sweet tomatoes. listening to the sound of the spanish guitar or piano, discovering new places or learning about new cultures, being with family or good friends, reading, walking and being who i am. how i could make a difference in this short yet wonderful life. depends hummmmmm, love to hold hands, hug and kiss. you are simple, romantic, honest, genuine, a one man woman and you are guided by values and principles.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
